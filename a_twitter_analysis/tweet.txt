atduskgreg   : @tomcoates aww. Well that's sweet. Ok I forgive you for the cannibalism 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @tomcoates next you're going to tell me that "flat whites" are made from the blood of boring Caucasians 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @tomcoates Brits eat boiled soldiers?!? How ghoulish 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @gilesgoatboy anti-globalism, often expressed in ugly xenophobic terms, has been a mainstay of the populist left and right for decades 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @vgr checkout this playbook from congressional Democratic staffers inspired by how they saw the Tea Party succeed: https://t.co/dLvXwIgUlz 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @vgr combination of metro and old fashioned politics: Democratic party building at every level. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @jhaand @MaxGeiger my first few drafts of this included explicit reference to the Baby Boomers 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @amyhoy yup you got me 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : A scifi dystopia in which new stories are forbidden and all future generations are doomed to retell their ancestors' beloved tales forever. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @AsherVo lately it feels like pacing and character development have been banned from blockbusters. It's all a series of random fetch quests. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : Throwing spaghetti at the wall is a reliable way to produce something with lots of twists. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @zunguzungu he looks enough like David Remnick I think he should play him in a biopic 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @eboyden3 Ender's Game! 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @sehurlburt and very few big company CEOs started the businesses they run. They don't even have your courage or entrepreneurship. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @jomc I love that movie 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @MaxTemkin maybe. So much of that work is per-character though. You think we'll see that much more Tarkin? 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @MaxTemkin I wonder if it was the product of the massive studio-forced rework of the last third of the film 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @chadfowler A New Hope. Its opening crawl spoiled the ending. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @zunguzungu same with Africa. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @zunguzungu the book makes passing reference to the Nazis having destroyed it and committed terrible atrocities there 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @pixlpa @jomc all space travel scifi is just a metaphor for driving on LA freeways at night 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @bruces believing you can get the benefits of collaboration without the sacrifice of actually collaborating is a core libertarian fantasy 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : Large ensemble serial TV storytelling is a bad influence on contemporary blockbuster movies. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @amyhoy this is so depressing 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @kcimc a lot of those ideas are still present in the deep roots of our art education system 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @kcimc you worked your way up from still life to landscape to genre to portrait (the more Royal the better) to history painting. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @kcimc we should grab beers soon and talk about the hierarchy of genres! Art ed was organized around history painting - basically propaganda 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @kcimc this book is really interesting on the two-way consraints of power and the art that represents it: https://t.co/v37dd4XWqY 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @kcimc I wrote my undergrad art history thesis on art academies and their relationship to the state 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @kcimc I mean that thorough history is any survey of Western art. Until 19th C it's a story of official portraits, history paintings, etc 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @kcimc it can be a political statement but no guarantee on which side. Long history of art serving power. Far more frequent than opposing it 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @Joi @slavin any help getting this in front of the right people at MIT to get something done about this? https://t.co/DnEXZDfexn 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @tomcoates never understood why those weren't call "bedeviled eggs" 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @genmon @benhammersley @GreatDismal pretty sure the cause of the Utopias was the bubbles of privilege those earlier authors lived in 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @CThursten that game involved a Divine Rapier that Luna bought, lost, and got back. And it wasn't even the most flabbergasting moment. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : Oh my god that game of Dota. Multiple Divine Rapiers, megas, back door invisible Earthshaker throne sneak. Just insane. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : Saw a suited Santa sans hat driving an 80s white Mercedes. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @jeffvandermeer a lot of this ends up coming down to who people are thinking of when they say "we" 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @mattyglesias this logic treats mental health as a second-class kind of health in way doctors have been trying to undo in recent years. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @hondanhon Paging Dan to the meme stream. Dan please report for meme duty... https://t.co/f88pjAZ0T5

 atduskgreg   : @quicklywilliam agreed. Hope to come to Portland before too long 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @quicklywilliam would love to hear 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @quicklywilliam this is a sad rant that very much matches my experience. FWIW I found a way out in video games. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @alper were those Pudge pulls happening at TI6? I didn't see any then 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : I don't watch competitive Dota for a little while and suddenly there's Rubick mid and some kind of Pudge mid creep pull strat?

 atduskgreg   : Throwing spaghetti at the wall is a reliable way to produce something with lots of twists. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @zunguzungu he looks enough like David Remnick I think he should play him in a biopic 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @eboyden3 Ender's Game! 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @sehurlburt and very few big company CEOs started the businesses they run. They don't even have your courage or entrepreneurship. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @jomc I love that movie 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @MaxTemkin maybe. So much of that work is per-character though. You think we'll see that much more Tarkin? 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @MaxTemkin I wonder if it was the product of the massive studio-forced rework of the last third of the film 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @chadfowler A New Hope. Its opening crawl spoiled the ending. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @zunguzungu same with Africa. 
 ** 
 atduskgreg   : @zunguzungu the book makes passing reference to the Nazis having destroyed it and committed terrible atrocities there
